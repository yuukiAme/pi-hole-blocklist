# pi-hole-blocklist
It's for my personal use. There is no license. Do what you want with it.


Why does this blocklist exist?
- I encounter websites or domains that annoy me. I will add it to this list. 
- I'm tired of starting my Pi-hole fresh after a corrupted SD card and lose some of my personal blacklist domains accumlated over time from Query log.
- I will use this list for Pi-hole. That's all.
- Since I have to work for MS, I have decided to seperate the blocklist to multiple parts to not block MS products.
